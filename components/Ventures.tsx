            <p>I’ve teamed up with the best “founders-in-remission” (exited founders that are resting) to provide the best advice fuel for acceleration for founders.</p>
            <p>As a founder & CEO for 9 years I wish I had someone who I could confide with, and ask all the questions - big or small. </p>
            <p>That’s what Growth Ventures is all about. It’s revealing the art and science behind growth.</p>
            <p>Through a carefully designed intake process, we work with founders through super early stage investment in tokens or equity (we like to be part of the first group of external funds raised), and advisory. We are here to provide you with what you need.</p>
